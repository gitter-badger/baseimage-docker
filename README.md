In order to ensure StackStrap is functioning we will always use
this fork when building its components. It will always contain
the codebase of the origin's `latest` release unless a major issue
is preventing StackStrap from working.

## You will likely be required to `--force` pull

This branch is being `--force` pushed to on a regular basis with
remote rebases.
