# This fork used for operational and build purposes

In order to ensure StackStrap is functioning we will always use
this fork when building its components. It will always contain
the codebase of the origin's `latest` release unless a major issue
is preventing StackStrap from working.

## You will likely be required to `--force` pull

This branch is being `--force` pushed to on a regular basis with
remote rebases.
